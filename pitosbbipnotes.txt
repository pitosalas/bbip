tweaks

- spinner on the splash screen while waiting for first poll?
- when is account checked? Should be checked as soon as info is entered in prefs, and error reported right there

- article extracts in top level list could be shorter
- article extracts also need a indication of what feed they are from
- when clicking a link that takes you to safari, the 'title bar' should say 'safari' (or whatever the standard is to tell user that they are now in the browser)

bugs

- when there is only one guide, there's no 'more' or icons. Looks ugly.
- mark on guide as mobile, synch, use bbip, go back to bb, mark another guide as mobile, sync again, checkbox gets unset in bb


new

- need a way to remind people that they are running against a default set of guides. Maybe one of the 'guide' buttons is fixed and has an icon called "trial". Or maybe there's a permanent bar (like some iphone apps show ads) that say "trial mode" that when you click displays instructions to sign up.

- Seems like we need an equivalent of the 'star' filter in BBiP. I am
thinking that this is a preference because I dont think it is changed
often enough but in my case I got many too many feeds in the guide I
synched.

Decisions:
- no smartfeeds
- 'simple' unread sync mechanism, that will break if we ever add a new feed type
